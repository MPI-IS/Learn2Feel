Learn2Feel
=========

**Learn2Feel** is a `Python` and `Matlab` framework for learning to predict the perceptual similarity of two surfaces using the force and torque data gathered while a human blindly explored two surfaces with their fingertips.

Requirements
------------

- [Python 3.6+](https://www.python.org/)
- [Numpy](https://numpy.org/)
- [PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/)
- [Fast Differentiable Sorting and Ranking](https://github.com/google-research/fast-soft-sort)

Installation
------------

**CityGraph** releases can be instaled from [PyPI](https://pypi.org/):

```
$ pip install city-graph
```

Alternatively, one can also clone the repository and install the package locally:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/MPI-IS/CityGraph.git
$ cd CityGraph
$ pip install .
```

We strongly advise to install the package in a dedicated virtual environment.

Tests
-----

To run the tests, simply do:

```
$ python -m unittest
```

Documentation
-------------

To build the `Sphinx` documentation:

```
$ pip install sphinx sphinx-bootstrap-theme
$ cd doc
$ make html
```
and open the file `build/html/index.html` in your web browser.
